  <p>Praneeth Tadepalli has completed his Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing (IIITDM) Kancheepuram, from 2021 to 2025 and is currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities..
    His academic interests lie in the areas of analog VLSI and neuromorphic circuit design. He has worked on neural circuits including integrate-and-fire neurons, adaptive exponential (AdEx) models, and axon hillock circuits. His research also includes the design of synaptic circuits implementing both pair-based spike-timing-dependent plasticity (PSTDP) and triplet-based STDP (TSTDP).
    In addition to CMOS-based approaches, he has explored memristor-integrated synapse designs using time-division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, focusing on compact and power-efficient neuromorphic systems. His work reflects a broader goal of developing bio-inspired hardware for next-generation computing.</p>
