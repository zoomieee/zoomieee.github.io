  <h1>Projects <img src="krusty-the-clown.webp" alt="GIF" class="gif"></h1>
  <h2>Neuromorphic and synapse circuits using Cadence Virtuoso</h2>
  
  <li>Learnt and simulated Neuron circuits like Axon Hillock, Voltage Amplifier Integrate and Fire
    Neuron and Low Power Integrate Fire Neuron.</li>
   <li> Worked on Analog Implementation of Synaptic Plasticity/learning rules with circuits like Pair
    and Triplet based Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity.</li>
   <li> Worked on different memristor models along with Pair and Triplet based Spike Timing
    Dependent Plasticity using Time Division Multiplexing.</li>
   <li> Currently working on hardware implementation of applications of Spike Neural Network</li>

   <h2>Charging circuit for Raspberry Pi 4 present in An Energy Efficient Fog-Based IoT Framework to
    Combat Wildlife Poaching</h2>
    <li> Designed a reliable charging circuit for a Raspberry Pi 4 with solar panel, battery pack, solar
        charge controller, voltage step up regulator , USB-C breakout board and for safety of this
        circuit capacitor, poly-fuse and a switch.</li>

        <h2> Assisted for segmentation of bacterial colonies in petri dish environment using python</h2>
        <li>Implemented a segmentation algorithm that combined Watershed and Fuzzy C-Means
            approaches to precisely identify bacterial colonies in a Petri dish setting.</li> 
          <li> Incorporated the Watershed algorithm for fine-grained segmentation after using Fuzzy C
           Means for initial clustering to account for inherent ambiguity. </li>
    <h2>Laser turret using arduino controlled via joystick</h2>
    <li>Designed a laser turret system with servo motors, an Arduino, and a joystick for accurate
        control and targeting.</li> 
    <li>   Facilitated the combination of software and hardware to improve security protocols,
        exhibiting expertise in creative problem-solving in a cross-functional environment.</li>       
    <h2> Hardware Implementation of Universal Active Filter</h2>
    <li> Built Universal Active Filter with LM 741 IC (OPAMP) that can give Low Pass, High Pass and
        Band Reject Pass responses in the same circuit.</li>
